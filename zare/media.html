<p><b>HOW DO THE STONES SPEAK OR "CROMLECH OF THE TIME"</b></p>

<p>At times one can catch a glimpse of some other reality beyond the journalists everyday routine that
instills optimism and makes to confess: what a joy that there are such people, especially when they are young and have much time ahead to do something important.</p>

<p>Zare shanbuzyan is that kind of a man. Aboriginal inhabitant of Yerevan. Ceramist - sculpturer by specialty. </p>

<p>Our acquaintance was a result of chance meting: we needed an advice concerning a newspaper design. Yes, it is pleasant to know that there are young men who do not fit into the common mold of knowledge and specialty, who see the life as an opnortunity to
new achievements through harmonizing the specialty with knowledge.</p>

<p>It all started tor him in 1984-1994-when he, as a student of the secondary school n. a. Chenov, atended the Ceramics department of the Republican Center of Artistic Education by the Ministry of Education of Amenia.</p>

<p><i>"I loved clay"</i> said Zare <i> "Ceramic classes had been inexplicably attracting me. The thing that was familiar to the mankind as a craft since the use of fire and highly practiced and widespread in Armenia is still topical. And I was captivated by it as a schoolboy. 
But the time made some correctiors..." </i></p>

<p>In 1994-200 he continued his education at the Department ot Sculpture ot the State Academy of Fine Arts of Armenia and graduated with the qualification of "painter-sculptor-teacher".

His artistic talent was refined by his tutors - renowned Armenian Sculplots, though his talent was the leading force. </p>

<p>To make an opinion cocerning the human and civil features of this young artist it is enough to say that in 2000-2002 he served in Armenian military forces and the years in army had been a specific period of self - assertion. In a patriotc ardour he started carving sculptures right in the regiment, carving the fallen heroes of the motherland and crosses - symbols of Christian faith.</p>

<p>Yet the period ot the most serious self-knowledge was still ahead. 
Ater release Zare was finaly and comfidentily determined to continue as a sculptor. Step by step conceptual works were born.</p>

<p>Success is not long in coming when the talent and industry meet. In 2003 he participated in 11th Dante Biennale held in Ravenna, Italy and became the first prize winner.</p>	
	
<p>Just for the readers notice I have to add that this traditional art festival that is the largest and most authoritative in the field of sculpture is organized since the 70-es of the past century.

Zare was among 2000 authors from 40 countries of all five continents who presented their works in compliance with the Biennale requirements this time relating to Dante's influence on three religions. And Zare Shahbazyan's "Cromlech of the Time" was awarded the first prize.</p>

<p>His second inmportant achievement was at the Sculpture Symposium in Yeghegnadzor,
Armenia where the fastidious and hard to please international experts in sculpture highly estimated Zare's work - "Vishapakagh". 

By the way since 2005 Zare is a member of the Artists Union of Armenia.</p>

<p>The time worked in favour of the perfection of Zare's professional qualities and as a result- new wonderful sculptures were created.
As an object of his special pride the young sculptor mentions the bust of Alexander Harutyunyan at the Komitas Pantheon belonging to his chisel jointly with his tutor prof. of sculpture Garegin Davtyan.</p>

<p>Sculptor Zare Shahbazyan is still working with the same creative ardour. 

With special responsibility and as a duty of honour he comes to Yerabloor where, by the government order, he is carving additional sculptures at the structure called "Berd Par" (Castle Dance) near the church.</p>

<p>At leisure he takes his children there. Karina and Hayk are studying at school yet, but in their father's interpretation they start perceiving what are the stones speaking about. The time will come and they will fully understand this fine and exceptional way of their father's self - expression and that he is going to say his own word and make his contribution in the history of Armenian sculpture.</p>

<p>Through bending and interpreting the stone Zare Shahbazyan is convincing us that Sculpture is one of the finest branches of art and that human imagination is able to breathe life and fate into the stone with immense might.</p>

<p>Zare Shahbazyan is distinctive. As distinctive as the Armenian sculpture itself.</p>
