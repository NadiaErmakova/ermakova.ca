		<div class="about">
			
			<p>On october 21st, 1977 an Artist was born in Armenia, Yerevan, who’s name is Zare Shahbazyan. </p>
			<p>Since he was a little kid he was very intrigued and fascinated by the art culture in Armenia. This led him to start drawing, painting and sculpting. As he grew up he mostly focused on sculpting. At the age of 16 Zare was participating in many art exhibitions to get his work out there. His passion for sculpting was so strong and so real, that he tried his best to be able to go to the best Armenian sculpting school for University. </p>
			
			<p>At the age of 21 Zare Shahbazyan had earned his masters degree in sculpting from State  Academy of Fine Arts of Armenia. After graduating from University Zare spent many years putting in extra hours to be the best of the best, which led him to win the first prize of Pop of the Xl International Biennale of Bronze Sculpture, for "The Cromplech time of Time" sculpture, only at the age of 26. In 2005 he became a member of Artists’ Union of RA. </p>
				
			<p>Since then Zare has been perfecting his skills on wood, stone, bronze and ceramics. It's safe to say that Zare managed to perfect all his skills on the different materials and enjoys spending every second of the day sculpting sculptures. As of today Zare spends all of his free time working with clay to make ceramics. Some of Zare's best work include special pieces of plates, bowls, decorative salt cellars, cup sets (coffee or tea) and wall sculpted ornaments that have been inspired by his Armenia culture.</p> 
			
			<p>Most of Zare’s work have been put up in art exhibitions and are being sold all around the world. </p>
