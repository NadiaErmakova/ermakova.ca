        <h1>Web Development Process</h1>
        <br/>


<p>Web site design/development requires planning and organization. From concept to regular maintenance, every web site is built with the standard process. Working through each phase ensures a well-structured site that delivers quality content and continues working for years to come.</p>

<p class="letter_spacing">Brainstorming</p>
<p>The first step of the web development process is brainstorming.  The ideas need to be written down first. Secondly, the structure of the content and information need to be thought about and decided on, such as categories and general topics. Lastly, overall design scheme such as colors and graphics decision needs to be finalized. Ask for the help of others; take their feedback. Simple research and Internet browsing often help generate ideas.</p>

<p class="letter_spacing">Developing a Site Map</p>
<p>The next logical step is to start to outline your web site. The content needs to be separated into topics and subtopics, keeping the purpose of the web site in mind. Web design, tools and platforms as well as methods of delivery should be thought of at this time in the process. </p>

<p class="letter_spacing">Graphic Design</p>
<p>The graphic design phase is when color schemes are decided, images are gathered and graphic page elements are created. It is important to have all graphic components ready to go for easy insertion.</p>

<p class="letter_spacing">Site Development</p>
<p>The site development phase is when web site is coded. Regular interaction with the client ensures that the site is up to the expectations. Frequent feedback is key to a successful development phase.</p>

<p class="letter_spacing">Testing</p>
<p>During the testing phase, a sample of end users try out the web site and give feedback. The designer tweaks the code until all parties are happy with the results. Web site has to be tested with a variety of web browsers and with users with disabilities.</p>

<p class="letter_spacing">Launch</p>
<p>The purpose of the launch phase is to prepare the web site for public viewing. This requires final polishing of design elements, deep testing of interactivity and features and, most of all, a consideration of the user experience. An important step in this phase is to move the web site to its permanent Web server.</p>

<p class="letter_spacing">Maintenance</p>
<p>The maintenance phase is an integral part of the web design process. All web sites require regular maintenance. Not only do technology standards change, but also new content is essential for attracting repeat and new visitors.</p></br>

<p>Each phase of the web design process is important in web site development. Brainstorming, outlining, visual design, coding, testing and maintenance are all essential. Working thoroughly through each phase to develop an appealing web site with useful content attracting regular visitors presently and in the future.</p>
